## 🧟‍♂️ Git Horror Stories Zone

This project’s commit history contains genuine artifacts of panic-merges, last-second backup tags, and at least one “whoops, closed the merge editor” event. All code and branches are healthy and working—just beware the haunted zig-zags you may find in the git graph.

**Future Me:**  
If you’re reading this, it all worked out.  
Enjoy the artifacts. May they remind you to always double-check your merge commits, and never fear a messy history.  
If you dare to clean it up, remember:  
`git tag backup-pre-cleanup` first!
